# A Stay In The Aftercastle
An arcade game based around surviving nights in a haunted casttle. Get all the loot and kill all the ghosts you can before daylight!

You must survive the entire night for your score to be added to your overall score

WASD to move
Swing mouse around to hit things with your sword
