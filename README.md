# A Stay In The Aftercastle
An arcade game based around surviving nights in a haunted casttle. Get all the loot and kill all the ghosts you can before daylight!
# Mechanics
The closer the timer gets to 0 the less health the ghosts have, but the more damage they do! Smash all the barrels and collect all the goblets you can before the timer runs out

You must survive the entire night for your score to be added to your overall score

# Controls
WASD to move
F/shift to attack

# About
This was made as a personal game jam project to create a fully realized game in a weekends time

# Future features
The game will be expanded upon in the following weeks. Things I want to add are as follows:
1. Visual representations of the ghosts state, things like getting smaller or maybe more transparent as the timer goes down
2. Hard Mode. The ability to go into the castle earlier each night to have more time per night but you have to face even beefier ghosts with higher score values
